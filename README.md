# Lazy Fuck

It's a brainfuck interpreter in Haskell so I guess it's ~lazy~ non-strict now. The only way you can really tell it's lazy though is by making it crash which you can do in a few different ways. I leave that as an exercise to the user though.

The REPL-y based functionality is still a WIP as I didn't want to use any libraries outside of `base`. Oh and hello world on wikipedia seems to crash the interpreter, though I can't seem to figure out why exactly.
