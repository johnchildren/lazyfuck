# Lazy Fuck

It's a brainfuck interpreter in Haskell so I guess it's ~lazy~ non-strict now. The only way you can really tell it's lazy though is by making it crash which you can do in a few different ways. I leave that as an exercise to the user though.

Oh and hello world on wikipedia seems to crash the interpreter, though I can't seem to figure out why exactly.
